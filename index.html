            focusing ones attention inward, letting external distractions and thoughts come and go naturally, observing without
            placing judgement. To the right you will find an instructional video to get you started.</div>

        <div id="breath-text">
            Breathwork is a term that encompasses a wide range of breathing exercises in which
            conscious control of the breath is used to influence a persons physical, emotional 
            or mental state. Breathwork goes hand in hand with other theraputic techniques such as 
            meditation. It has its roots in yoga and has been practiced in some parts of the world 
            for thousands of years. Recently it has become more established in the mainstream, popularized 
            by proponents such as Wim Hof. To the right you will find an instructional video, simply breath
            along.

        <div id="cal-text">Calesthenics is a form of strength training that uses compound movements to exercise
            large muscle groups, usually only using bodyweight or with minimal equiptment. They are intended to increase
            strength and flexibility, improving posture while reducing the risk of developing muscle imbalances. There are 
            records of the practice being used as far back as ancient Greece and China.
