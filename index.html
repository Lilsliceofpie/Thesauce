        <div id="breath-text">
            Breathwork is a term that encompasses a wide range of breathing exercises in which
            conscious control of the breath is used to influence a persons physical, emotional

            meditation. It has its roots in yoga and has been practiced in some parts of the world 
            for thousands of years. Recently it has become more established in the mainstream, popularized 
            by proponents such as Wim Hof. To the right you will find an instructional video, simply breath
